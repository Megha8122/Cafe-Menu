Welcome to my GitHub page showcasing a delightful project ‚Äì a cafe menu website crafted with HTML and CSS under the guidance of FreeCodeCamp! üöÄ

In this project, I've honed my web development skills by delving into the world of front-end technologies. Through FreeCodeCamp's expert guidance, I've created a visually appealing and user-friendly cafe menu website. The project not only allowed me to apply HTML and CSS fundamentals but also provided insights into responsive design, layout, typography, and color choices.

Key Features of the Cafe Menu Website:
1. **HTML Structure:** Explore the well-organized HTML structure that forms the foundation of the cafe menu website. Each element is thoughtfully structured to ensure accessibility and ease of maintenance.

2. **CSS Styling:** Immerse yourself in the world of CSS as I applied styling techniques to enhance the visual appeal of the cafe menu. From selecting the right color palette to crafting engaging typography, every detail has been meticulously considered.

3. **Responsive Design:** Experience the website's responsiveness as it seamlessly adapts to various screen sizes. Responsive design principles ensure an optimal viewing experience for users across desktops, tablets, and mobile devices.

4. **FreeCodeCamp Guidance:** This project wouldn't be possible without the invaluable guidance from FreeCodeCamp. I've leveraged their tutorials, challenges, and community support to deepen my understanding of web development concepts.

Feel free to explore the code, provide feedback, or use it as a learning resource. I hope this project inspires and serves as a testament to the skills I've gained on my coding journey. Cheers to learning and coding adventures! üåê‚ú®
